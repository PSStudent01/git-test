# git-test

Per frontendmentor, I did teh following to link my GitHub repo to my local Git repo:
echo "# git-test" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/PSStudent01/git-test.git
git push -u origin main


-  Try out the following commands
-- Update your README.md file inside VS Code to add some text and then save the file. Run 'git status', and you should see that Git has tracked your changes and says the README.md file has been modified. This means your changes are ready to stage....{DONE}

-- Stage the file using 'git add README.md', commit using 'git commit -m "update README.md"', and then push to the remote using 'git push'...{DONE}

-- Refresh your browser on GitHub, and you should now see the updates you made to your README.md file showing on GitHub!...{DONE}
